### Hi! I'm Ivan ðŸ‘‹

I am a dedicated software developer who enjoys working on frontend development and solving problems creatively. I have experience in building user-friendly interfaces and reliable backend systems, and I like creating web applications that are useful for people. Outside of work, I do CrossFit and participate in open-source projects to connect with other developers.
