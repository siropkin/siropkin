### Hi! I'm Ivan 👋

I'm a frontend developer based in Saint Petersburg, Russia.

In the past, I got big manager experience but a while ago I followed my dreams and became a developer passionate about web development, the development of UI kits, charts, maps, dashboards, etc.

In my free time, I do fitness 🤸‍♂️ or open-source projects 👾, for example, [🏁 Final Form Focus On Fist Field](https://github.com/siropkin/final-form-focus-on-first-field) or [Kata](https://github.com/Atarity/Kata).
